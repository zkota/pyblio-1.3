  abstract       = {Molecular fusions of CD4, the receptor for human
                   immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with immunoglobulin
                   (termed CD4 immunoadhesins) possess both the
                   gp120-binding and HIV-blocking properties of
                   recombinant soluble CD4, and certain properties of IgG,
                   notably long plasma half-life and Fc receptor binding.
                   Here we show that a CD4 immunoadhesin can mediate
                   antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
                   towards HIV-infected cells, although, unlike natural
                   anti-gp120 antibodies, it does not allow ADCC towards
                   uninfected CD4-expressing cells that have bound soluble
                   gp120 to the CD4 on their surface. In addition, CD4
                   immunoadhesin, like natural IgG molecules, is
                   efficiently transferred across the placenta of a
                   primate. These observations have implications for the
                   therapeutic application of CD4 immunoadhesins,
                   particularly in the area of perinatal transmission of
                   HIV infection.},

                   jaundice and ascites occurred in two out of seven
                   patients with chronic hepatitis D during interferon
                   alpha administration (10 MU three times a week). Both
                   of them were young women with histological diagnoses of
                   moderate to severe chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis with
                   no signs of portal hypertension. Only a slow and
                   partial recovery was observed after interferon
                   withdrawal. Autoantibodies against basal cell layer
                   tested positive in these two patients. In the remaining
                   five patients with hepatitis D who did not experience
                   liver impairment during interferon administration,
                   basal cell layer antibodies were found only in one
                   case. We conclude that severe decompensation of liver
                   cirrhosis related to hepatitis D may occur during
                   interferon administration. Positivity of basal cell
                   layer antibodies may be associated with the risk of
                   developing such an adverse event but our data are not
                   sufficient to prove this association.},

  abstract       = {Recently the main targets of antimitochondrial
                   antibodies (AMA) of primary biliary cirrhosis have been
                   identified as parts of three related mitochondrial
                   multienzyme complexes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase
                   (PDH), branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase
                   (BKDH) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
                   (alpha-KGDH). Usually AMA- positive PBC serum samples
                   show reactivity to more than one of these, raising the
                   question whether they are exclusively different
                   antibodies or are, at least in part, the result of
                   cross-reactive specificities. With Western
                   immunoblotting, four antigens with molecular masses of
                   74, 52, 51 and 43 kDa, are recognized by PBC sera. In
                   this study, using affinity purified antibodies from
                   mitochondrial proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose
                   blots, we demonstrate the presence of peptide-specific
                   and cross-reactive epitopes in some targets. In
                   particular, at least three different epitopes present
                   in the 74-kDa protein (presumed to by PDH-E2) are also
                   present in the 51-kDa protein (probably PDH-X), and two
                   in the 52-kDa peptide (possibly BCKDH-E2). Moreover,
                   the 43-kDa mitochondrial protein (the identity of which
                   is more problematic) has three epitopes. One of these
                   is also present in the 74-, 52- and 51-kDa proteins, a
                   second in the 74- and 51-kDa, and a third seems to be
                   peptide-specific. These results show that different
                   sera with the same immunoblotting pattern of reactivity
                   can have antibodies with different antigenic
                   specificities and, conversely, that the same
                   specificity can be responsible for more than one band.},

                   diagnostic marker of autoimmune hepatitis type 2, is
                   also found in a proportion of patients with hepatitis C
                   virus infection (HCV). It is detected conventionally by
                   the subjective immunofluorescence technique. Our aim
                   was to establish a simple and objective enzyme-linked
                   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that measures antibodies to
                   cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6), the target of LKM1. An
                   indirect ELISA using eukaryotically expressed CYP2D6
                   was designed. Absorbance values obtained against a
                   reference microsomal preparation were subtracted from
                   those obtained against a microsomal preparation
                   over-expressing CYP2D6, thus removing the non-
                   CYP2D6-specific reaction. Sera from 51 LKM1 positive
                   patients (21 autoimmune hepatitis and 30 with HCV
                   infection), 111 LKM1 negative patients with chronic
                   liver disease (including 20 with HCV infection) and 43
                   healthy controls were tested. Of 51 patients positive
                   by immunofluorescence, 48 were also positive by ELISA
                   while all the 154 LKM1 negative subjects were also
                   negative by ELISA. There was a high degree of
                   association between IFL and ELISA as demonstrated by a
                   kappa reliability value of 0.96. The absorbance values
                   by ELISA correlated with immunofluorescence LKM1 titres
                   both in autoimmune hepatitis (r = 0.74, p < 0.001) and
                   HCV infection (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). The simple,
                   objective ELISA described has the potential to replace
                   the standard immunofluorescence technique.},

                   studies report an increased prevalence of
                   non-organ-specific autoantibodies (NOSAs) in patients
                   with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related chronic liver
                   disease (CLD). Some of the data so far available are
                   controversial and the true prevalence of NOSAs in the
                   general population is still not known. AIM: To explore
                   the prevalence of NOSAs, their relation to different
                   HCV genotypes, and the presence and severity of CLD in
                   the general population of Northern Italy. PATIENTS: All
                   226 anti-HCV positive and 87 hepatitis B surface
                   antigen (HBsAg) positive patients of the Dionysos
                   cohort study were analysed and compared with sex and
                   age matched cases (226) negative for both anti-HCV
                   antibody and HBsAg selected from the same cohort.
                   METHODS: Sera tested for the presence of NOSAs
                   (anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle
                   antibody (SMA), and anti-liver/kidney microsomes type 1
                   antibody (LKM1)) were screened by indirect
                   immunofluorescence at a 1:40 serum dilution. HCV RNA
                   and HCV genotypes were also determined by nested
                   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 5' non-coding
                   region and by PCR amplification of the core region with
                   type specific primers. RESULTS: The overall prevalence
                   of NOSA reactivity was significantly higher in anti-HCV
                   positive subjects than in both normal and pathological
                   controls (25\% v 6\% and 7\% respectively, p<0.05).
                   ANA, SMA, and LKM1 occurred in 16, 10, and 1. 3\% of
                   cases respectively. No specific association between
                   NOSAs and a specific HCV genotype was found. NOSAs were
                   found more often associated with more than one genotype
                   (35.7\%) and with untypable genotypes (34.6\%),
                   although the association was not statistically
                   significant. NOSAs were associated with HCV RNA and CLD
                   but not with the presence of cirrhosis and/or
                   hepatocellular carcinoma. On univariate analysis, NOSA
                   reactivity was independently associated with abnormal
                   alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and
                   gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels (p<0.05). The risk
                   for the presence of NOSAs was 5.1 times higher in
                   anti-HCV subjects than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the
                   general population the prevalence of NOSAs is higher in
                   anti-HCV positive subjects than in normal or disease
                   controls. Moreover NOSAs are associated with CLD and
                   with a more active disease in terms of alanine
                   aminotransferase activity.},

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1
                   (LKM1) and liver cytosol antibody type 1 (LC1) are the
                   serological markers of type 2 autoimmune hepatitis
                   (AIH). AIMS: Since LKM1 and LC1 react against two
                   distinct liver specific autoantigens (cytochrome
                   P450IID6 (CYP2D6) and a 58 kDa cytosolic polypeptide
                   respectively), the aim was to see whether LKM1 and LC1
                   concentrations correlate with liver disease activity.
                   PATIENTS: Twenty one patients with type 2 AIH were
                   studied. METHODS: All sera were tested by indirect
                   immunofluorescence, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and
                   immunoblotting visualised by enhanced
                   chemiluminescence. To evaluate LKM1 and LC1 levels, the
                   50 kDa microsomal reactivity (corresponding to CYP2D6)
                   and the 58 kDa cytosolic reactivity were quantified by
                   densitometric analysis. RESULTS: Seven patients were
                   positive for LKM1, nine for LC1, and five for both.
                   Serial serum samples at onset and during
                   immunosuppressive treatment were analysed in 13
                   patients (four positive for LKM1, six positive for LC1
                   and three positive for both). During remission, LKM1
                   concentration remained essentially unchanged in six of
                   seven patients, and decreased in only one. Conversely,
                   in two of nine patients, LC1 was completely lost, and,
                   in the remaining seven, LC1 concentration was reduced
                   by more than 50\%. After immunosuppression tapering or
                   withdrawal, flare ups of liver necrosis ensued with
                   increasing LC1 concentration, but not LKM1.
                   CONCLUSIONS: LC1 concentration, at variance with that
                   of LKM1, parallels liver disease activity, and its
                   participation in the pathogenic mechanisms of liver
                   injury can be hypothesised.},

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Hypertransaminasaemia of unknown,
                   cryptogenic, origin occasionally has been found to be
                   the only sign of coeliac disease. Raised concentrations
                   of transaminases, or aminotransferases, have been
                   retrospectively observed in about a half of patients
                   with coeliac disease who are on a gluten-containing
                   diet. We aimed to establish the overall prevalence of
                   coeliac disease among patients with cryptogenic
                   hypertransaminasaemia. METHODS: Of the 600 consecutive
                   patients referred to our outpatient clinic for liver
                   disease due to raised serum transaminases from
                   September, 1995, to June, 1997, 55 were classified as
                   having cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia after the
                   exclusion of every known cause of liver disease. These
                   patients were tested by indirect immunofluorescence for
                   IgA to endomysium and for IgA and IgG to gliadin.
                   FINDINGS: Five patients were positive for both IgA to
                   endomysium and IgG to gliadin, whereas IgA to gliadin
                   was only found in four patients. IgG to gliadin was
                   also present in another patient who was not positive
                   for antibodies to endomysium. The six antibody-
                   positive patients had duodenal biopsy that showed a
                   subtotal villous atrophy consistent with coeliac
                   disease in the five patients with antibodies to
                   endomysium. The patient with only IgG to gliadin had a
                   normal small-intestine mucosa. None of the five
                   patients with coeliac disease had gastrointestinal
                   symptoms. Liver biopsy samples were taken from three of
                   the five patients with flat mucosa and showed a
                   histological picture of nonspecific reactive hepatitis.
                   Transaminase concentrations reverted to normal within 6
                   months in four patients with coeliac disease who
                   followed a strict gluten-free diet. INTERPRETATION: Our
                   results show that about 9\% of patients with
                   cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia are affected by
                   symptom-free coeliac disease. Gluten-sensitive
                   enteropathy and antibody screening for coeliac disease
                   by means of antibodies to endomysium and gliadin should
                   be considered in these patients.},

                   immunofluorescence and immunoglobulin A and G
                   antibodies to gliadin by enzyme immunoassay. Duodenal

                   seropositive for immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial
                   antibodies. Immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies

                   Immunoglobulin A antibodies to gliadin were found in
                   six of these eight patients, but they were also present
                   in two others, including one patient with chronic

                   cirrhosis or chronic viral hepatitis had antiendomysial
                   antibodies. The presence of celiac disease in
                   autoimmune hepatitis is high (at least one in 36
                   patients) and it is predominantly asymptomatic.
                   Screening with anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin

                   of which are well documented and include a panel of
                   auto-antibodies shared with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).
                   Anti-nuclear (ANA) and smooth muscle (SMA) antibodies
                   (markers of AIH type 1 [AIH-1]), have been demonstrated
                   in 9-38\% and 5-91\% of cases respectively, whereas
