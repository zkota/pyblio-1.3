=================================================================

Pybliographer provides a framework for working with bibliographic
databases.

For more information, please consult the documentation at:

	http://pybliographer.org/

=================================================================


* Requirements
  ------------

Before installing pybliographer, please install:

       
  - pyblio-core (v >= 1.3.x)
  - python-bibtex (also available from http://pybliographer.org/)
  - GNU Recode (v. 3.5)
  - Gnome 2.x and gnome-python 2.x

* Installation 
  ------------

Basically, it should be a matter of:

	./configure && make
	su
	make install

You can then run several programs :

  - pybliographic : the graphical interface
  - pybliographer : the text-based interface and scripting language
  - pybcheck, pybconvert, pybformat, ... : several useful tools

For more configuration options, have a look at the output of ./configure --help

* Troubleshooting
  ---------------

If the configure script reports the following errors:

 ** "error in python modules dependencies:  No module named ..."
 
   This means that a required module is not installed. Unfortunately,
   depending on your distribution, the actual package to install can
   be named differently. Check on the help pages of your distribution.

 ** "broken recode version"

   Your recode package does not behave properly.  Consult
   http://pybliographer.org/RecodeHelp for more information.
