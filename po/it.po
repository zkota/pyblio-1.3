#. the object has no more channels
#. print object, channel, args
#. don't use try: del ... ; except KeyError here. That would create a
#. new reference of object in a traceback object and this method should
#. be callable from a __del__ method (at least for versions prior
#. Python 1.5)
#. for debugging
#. the new finalization code in 1.5.1 might bind RemovePublisher
#. to None before all objects derived from Publisher are deleted...
#. Put message in the queue. If it is already queued put it at
#. the end. This is done to make certain that no channel gets
#. called twice between two calls to flush_message_queue. If the
#. order of channel invocation is important two or more queues
#. should be used.
#. Issue all queued messages and make the queue empty
#.
#. Issueing messages might result in new messages being queued.
#. This does not happen in sketch yet (Jul 1997) but let's hope
#. that we don't get infinite loops here...
